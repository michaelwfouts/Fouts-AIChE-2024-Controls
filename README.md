# Modeling Online Dynamic Processes with Fast Training Gaussian Processes

This repository provides the analysis and work presented at AIChE 2024 evaluating different methodologies for speeding up the training of Gaussian Processes for use in a Model Predictive Controller (MPC).  The specific use case of this work predicts the dynamics of the cascaded tanks system, a non-linear control benchmark.  This project specifically looks at the training of the model and the controls aspect is outside of the scope. For presentation slides, please email presenter at mwfouts@mix.wvu.edu.
